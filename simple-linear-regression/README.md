# Simple Linear Regression Manual


#### -- Project Status: Completed

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of the project is to apply mahcine learning knowledge about linear regression, building a class that performs linear regression using only the numpy library.

### Methods Used
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, Jupyter, NumPy

## Project Description
The project used the pandas library to read and manipulate dataframes, in addition to the numpy library to manipulate numbers and matrices. To apply statistical knowledge, a class was made to represent the linear regression model, which was later used to train the model and predict the data.

## Needs of this project

- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
